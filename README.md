# bike_rentals

Srchout Software Internship Assignment

## Getting Started

The project contains three screens as mentioned in the Figma file.
You can visit the second screen(i.e.) bike details page by clicking any bike on the home page in the recently viewed and popular items section.
All the values like title, speed and rent pricing are dynamic on both the homepage and bike details page and are based upon dummy data values that I have picked.
You can visit the third screen(i.e.) checkout page by clicking on the rent button.
All buttons like rent and add items are working.
Also, the calendar date picker and the payment button are working fine.
